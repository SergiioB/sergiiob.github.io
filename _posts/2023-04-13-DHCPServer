<h1>DEBIAN DHCP SERVER<h1>
<p>First, install the necessary packages:</p>

<pre>
<code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install y isc-dhcp-server</code>
</pre>

<br>

<p>Edit the configuration file:</p>

<pre>
<code>sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</code>
</pre>

<br>

<p>Start the DHCP server on the server (ESSENTIAL):</p>

<pre>
<code>service isc-dhcp-server start</code>
</pre>

<br>

<p>Check the status of the DHCP server:</p>

<pre>
<code>service isc-dhcp-server status</code>
</pre>

<br>

<p>NOW ON THE WINDOWS CLIENTS:</p>

<br>

<p>Set the clients to obtain IP addresses automatically and specify the DNS server as the IP address of the Linux server (not necessary for this exercise).</p>

<br>

<p>In client1, the IP address 192.168.100.5 will be assigned from the previously specified address range.</p>

<br>

<p>When running the command "service isc-dhcp-server status" on the server:</p>

<br>

<p>We can see the process where client1 requests the IP address from the server.</p>

<br>

<p>Client1 is now communicating with the server using the newly assigned IP address.</p>

<br>

<p>ON CLIENT 2:</p>

<br>

<p>Client2 has been assigned the next available IP address (192.168.100.6).</p>

<br>

<p>CONNECTIVITY TESTS:</p>

<br>

<p>ADDITIONAL CAPTURE:</p>

<br>

<p>We can see that the DHCP service is running (active).</p>

<br>

<p>The configuration file is indicated by the purple arrow.</p>

<br>

<p>The communication process between the clients and the server involves exchanging REQUEST packets between the IP addresses of the clients (192.168.100.5, 192.168.100.6) and the server (192.168.100.1) as the destination.</p>
